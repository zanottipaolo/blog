## Why a blog in 2024? 🤔

<Callout type="info">I'll use tons of emoticons, wherever I can.</Callout>

Ok, here we are, so let's try to answer this question.

First of all, I'm not only a software engineer, I'm also Paolo, a 23 y/o guy with other interestes
besides computer science. I build the portfolio section of this website to reach new clients and show my works
to companies who want to start new collaboration or even hire me. But the blog section, instead, **addresses
all those who share same passions and thoughts**.

I also want to improve my english writing skills, like I'm trying to do with speaking and listening (podcasts, YouTube videos, TV series and so on).
My goal is to **reduce grammar error and become more fluent** as I'm in Italian. Feel free to correct me.
For how world works in 2024 I think it's an essential skill if you want to grow and get out of your comfort zone.
I would also like to improve my French, but it's more difficult since I haven't studied it since 2015. 😅

Then for my projects I had to read many articles from other developers' blog that were very helpful, so in this way I hope to **help someone else
who is struggling** just as I was. Or recommend to other people experiences that I have already had, such as reading a book, watch a TV series, etc.

I'd say we can start, so have a good reading and please be kind. 🙏🏻 😂
