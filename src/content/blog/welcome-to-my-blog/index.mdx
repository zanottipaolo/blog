## Why a blog in 2024? ðŸ¤”

<Callout type="info">I'll use tons of emoticons, wherever I can.</Callout>

Ok, here we are, so let's try to answer to this question.

First of all, I'm not only a software engineer, I'm also Paolo, a 23 y/o guy with other interestes
besides computer science. I build the portfolio section of this website to reach new clients and show my works
to companies who want to start new collaboration or even hire me. But the blog section, instead, addresses
all those who share same passions and thoughts.

I also want to improve my english writing skills
